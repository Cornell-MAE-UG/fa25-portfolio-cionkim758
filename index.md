## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}.

I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with experience in designing, building, and testing mechanical systems across vehicle, aerospace, and hardware applications. I enjoy working through the full engineering process—from defining requirements and creating initial models to fabricating components, running tests, and refining designs based on data. My work on the Cornell Electric Vehicles team has involved developing steering mechanisms, performing FEA to understand structural behavior, and collaborating with electrical and software members on system integration. In the Space Systems Design Studio, I helped manufacture and test deployable chip-satellites, gaining experience with vibration, thermal-vacuum, and reliability testing. My internship at Sensata Technologies allowed me to contribute to test fixture design and verification in an industrial setting. Across these experiences, I’ve learned to approach engineering problems carefully, communicate well with cross-functional teams, and stay attentive to both technical details and practical constraints.
